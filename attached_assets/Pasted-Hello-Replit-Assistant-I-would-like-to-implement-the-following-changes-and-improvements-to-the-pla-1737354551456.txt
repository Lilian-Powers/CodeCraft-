Hello, Replit Assistant. I would like to implement the following changes and improvements to the platform:

Persistent User Registration:

When a user logs out and returns later, they should not be forced to register again. Instead, their registration should be permanent, and they should only need to log in unless they want to change their credential details.
Start Coding Button Redirection:

The “Start Coding” button on the homepage should redirect users directly to the Tutorials page, where they can begin the tutorials immediately.
Editor Page Header Update:

On the editor page for Lesson 1, replace the header "Python Practical for Lesson 1" with a new heading:
“This video provides instructions on how to download Python and VS Code for use in our coding projects.”
Next and Back Buttons for Navigation:

Add Next and Back buttons to all pages, allowing users to easily navigate forward or back to the previous page.
Renaming Tutorials Link:

Rename the “Tutorials” link to “Tutorials Part 1” for clarity and consistency.
Homepage Accessibility Before Login:

Allow the homepage to be accessible without requiring login or registration so that visitors can view the website's contents. However, if they click on any links, they should be prompted to log in or register if they have not done so yet.
Responsive and Attractive Homepage Design:

Style and position elements on the homepage in a professional, responsive, and visually attractive manner. Include relevant images from the internet to make the page more appealing to visitors, increasing the chances of converting them into users.
Add Editors Link to the Homepage:

Include the Editors link on the homepage alongside other quick links to make it easily accessible to users.
Treasure Hunt Editor Improvement:

Ensure that each question in the treasure hunt has its own dedicated editor, making it easier for new users to know where to write their code.
The treasure collection should update automatically when the user wins, and any duplicate or unused code should be removed.
Please help implement these features to improve the user experience and functionality of the platform. Let me know if you need any further information or clarification.

Thank you!
