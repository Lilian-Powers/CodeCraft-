organize the images in the carousel with the most attractive to start so that they can attract and maintain the users attention and be appealing to them. lets change things a bit, rename the python tutorial part 2 page to a nice short name about the calculator so that that page can be for the calculator only for now, have a link for it in the quck links and in the nav bar. then let all the tutorials be in one page the one named tutorials part1 give it another nice short name but make it so it has sections like all the content in the tutorials part1 page right now will be in section 1 and the tutorials for section 2 will be coming soon organise style use fonts and colours that you think are the best to style and position elements in this page professionally so that it is easier on the user/learners, have a link for it in the quck links and in the nav bar.

I see the issue. The calculator link is not working because we need to update the route in app.py. Let's add a specific route for the calculator page and update the navigation links.

app.py
Reverted
Add calculator route
Now when you click on the calculator link, it should work correctly. The calculator page is using the same template as tutorials_part2.html but with a dedicated route.
