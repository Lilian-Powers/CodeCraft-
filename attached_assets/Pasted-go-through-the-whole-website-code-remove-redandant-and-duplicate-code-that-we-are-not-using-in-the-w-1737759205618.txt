I notice from the console errors that several JavaScript functions are undefined, which is causing the practice projects not to work. Let's add the missing JavaScript functions to handle the modals and game interactions. I'll update the tutorials.html file:

templates/tutorials.html
Add missing JavaScript functions for modals and games
This update adds all the missing JavaScript functions that were causing the errors in the console. It includes:

Modal toggle functionality
Age calculator game logic
Story generator functionality
