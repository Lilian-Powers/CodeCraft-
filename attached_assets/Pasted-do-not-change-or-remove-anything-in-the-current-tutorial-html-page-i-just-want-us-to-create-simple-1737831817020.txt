i just want us to create simple games using if elif and else with the 
code am going to give you put the games directly after the practical
 implementation simple calculator video in learning hub page. 
style this games the best way you can for them to be attractive 
and appealing to the user so that they are compeled to keep playing 
use the styles that are best to make the games responsive and 
function well. organize the games proffessionally and use the best 
font for their headers. the first game use this code 
nickname = input("What is our nickname, my love? ")
if nickname.lower() == "sweetheart":
print(f"Aww, you’re making me blush! I will miss you, {nickname}.")
elif nickname.lower() == "darling":
print(f"Darling, you're too sweet! I will miss you more than you know, {nickname}.")
elif nickname.lower() == "cutie":
print(f"Cutie, I’ll miss you too, but don’t expect me to stop thinking about you!")
else:
print(f"Hmm, {nickname}? Well, I guess I’ll miss you… but only a little. 😉"),
the second game use this code, current_year = 2025
birth_year = int(input("What year were you born? "))
age = current_year - birth_year

if age < 18:
print(f"You're just a baby! You are {age} years old! Wait till you get to the fun part of life! 😜")
elif 18 <= age < 25:
print(f"Ah, you're in your prime! You're {age} years old! Enjoy it while it lasts! 😉")
elif 25 <= age < 40:
print(f"You're in the golden years! {age} years old, huh? You're starting to get wiser... but also closer to needing reading glasses! 😂")
elif 40 <= age < 60:
print(f"Whoa, you're {age} years old? Still young at heart, but do you need a nap after this? 😅")
else:
print(f"{age} years young! The wisdom must be overflowing by now, huh? 🤔"), for the third game use this code, name = input("Enter your name, little star: ")
age = int(input("How old are you, champ? "))

if age <= 5:
print(f"Wow, {name.upper()}! You're so little and cute! Just {age} years old? You're still a baby! 🍼")
elif 6 <= age <= 8:
print(f"Hey, {name.upper()}! You're {age} now! Getting bigger and smarter every day, huh? 😎")
elif 9 <= age <= 12:
print(f"Look at you, {name.upper()}! Already {age} years old, huh? Almost a teenager, I see! 😉")
elif 13 <= age <= 15:
print(f"Whoa, {name.upper()}! You're {age} already? That means you're practically so cool now! 😜")
else:
print(f"Nice to meet you, {name.upper()}! You’re {age} years old, huh? Still young, but feeling super grown up! 🤩")
include a 
text that informs the user that they need to try out 
differrnt answers to see how the conditional statements if 
elif and else works.
